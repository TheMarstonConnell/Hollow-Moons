# Figures of Joy

Figures of Joy (FOJ) is a generative art piece minted on the Tezos Blockchain with FxHash. FOJ is an exploration of depth and motion. 
The goal of this experiment was to create objects that seemed as though they were growing and contorting through a three-dimensional space with its own 
lighting.
